# mzd-usb-sensors

Enables additional custom apps on MZD CMU to poll data from external sensors via usb connected microcontrollers.

This README is not final.

## How it works:

**TBD**

```
CMU                  Microcontroller via USB

└─ App ─ [usbget] ─ [usbunit]
   │      │          │  (optional:)
   *.out-files       ├─ CC1101 433 MHz receiver     ─ (OEM) 433 MHz TPMS sensors
                     ├─ onboard BLE receiver¹       ─ BLE TPMS sensors²
                     └─ wire connected sensors ────── oil pressure or temperature sensors³


¹ RedBear Duo (OOP) is supported, for other boards or BLE receivers the code needs to be changed and adapted in order to be supported.
² depending on the BLE protocol and the decoding of the signal, the necessary code in usbunit needs to be changed and adapted.
³ depending on the sensor, the calculation of the incoming signal needs to be changed and adapted.

#### Thanks:

Wolfix for coming up with the main protocol when he heard that I wanted the CMU to communicate with a usb connected microcontroller, for the support and all the updates and ideas! I can't thank you enough!

jayrockk for supporting the idea from the beginning, for all the help with receiving the 433 MHz signals and for the work on the PCBs.
